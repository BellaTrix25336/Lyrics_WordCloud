LOVE IN THE TIME OF GAZA
            I was born  inside the rain on a day of wonder
            Deep inside my brain memories of thunder
            I grew up a refugee, my life not fixed or free
            I know the world’s not to blame
            Cos’ everybody carries my name 
CHORUS:
            Oooh! These are my Fathers’ people – (Hawu Ngitshele!  Ngitshele! - tell me! tell me!)
            Oooh! This is where the Human tree once grew
            Oooh !  We are the  children of  a new world
            Oooh ! We have a new dream pushing through
The sky is black with gunships , but I’m dreaming of a girl
            In her eyes love   and friendship , but will she understand my world ?
            Now I’m like a windswept sea, fear  and hope washing over me
            Will she think my world is cruel , when I share my point  of view?
CHORUS
Oh …It’s a strange world …   hawu ngitshele !  Ngitshele !yeah!
            Oh ..It’s  a caged  bird …yeah!
            Oh…gimme what you say ….yeah!
            Oh… gimme a brand new day …yeah!
CHORUS
 
                
THE WORLD IS  CALLING
Tonight I had a happy hour
            And loved your gentle style
            I grabbed the day with both hands
            It has taken me a while
            I’ve been waiting to breathe out
            To look up  and see  you smile
            Walking through your laughing country
            Free from exile
CHORUS
            But  I must rise now  and leave your company
            The world is calling and the road is longer
            And as I go now my heart is breaking 
            Will I ever see you again?          
Through all tribulation 
            Through all fake pretence
            Just  an hour of  your company
            Gives my life true sense
            Like a prisoner holding out
            For a final visit
            I see you through my empty glass
            And you can fill it 
CHORUS
But I must rise now   and leave your company
            The world is calling    and the road is longer
            And as I go now my heart is breaking
            For will I ever see you again?
            What is this feeling and I hardly know you?
            What is this sorrow as I walk away ?
Hold onto this night forever
            Hold onto this night – remember!
 
ALL I GOT IS  YOU
 I lie here in the  dark
            On my own
            I see the stars , they make me smile
  ‘Cos they  are so  far and I feel I can touch them
I know you 
            Like the stars
            Are so far 
            You make me cry 
            As I lie here 
  ‘cos I know I  am  lost without you
CHORUS
            All I got is you babe , all I got is you  baby!
            Take my fortress with a kiss , shoot your arrow  and never miss
            All I got is you babe, all I got is you baby!
            Helter skelter in the swelter, through the hard night give  me shelter 
I , saw you 
            Dancing free
   Like a soul that  was on fire
            I saw the glow
            And the crowd did cheer and the king was smiling
CHORUS
            ANY DREAM WILL DO BABE , AS LONG AS IT’S WITH YOU !

            (What have we done to deserve  this?
You know this hard for me
            Facing the judgement of history
            I’m a small man ,I never stood up against anything at all
            Always been just   another brick in the wall
            It’s hard to know how to make a change
            It’s hard to give up what you got  and just walk away
            So I got to go now    and face this day
            Goodbye my friend, goodbye          
You know it’s so hard to fight 
            On your own against the fading of the light 
            From the school to the church to heart of the state
            To the invisible power of the hidden hand of hate
            Where was I when this all began
            From the father to the son to the man
            So I gotta now   ,  and fact this day
            Goodbye my friend ,goodbye

            Looking around , I saw you ,sitting with us sinners
            And so you fill my mind,  give me a new design

HIDDEN AWAY  DOWN
Clear summer day
            You became the prey
            You gave your best defence
            Your smile was just pretence
            You want to shout , nothing comes out
            A shadow blocks the sun
            Where does that day live where part of you did drown ?
CHORUS:
Hidden  away down 
            Hidden away down deep inside
            Didn’t the day drown?
            Didn’t the day drown in the night?
            You running away now
            You running away till the morning light
            A criminal take –down
            A criminal take-down with no fight          
Pretend confidence 
            Keep the beast at bay
            Like a fugitive
            It’s you yourself you blame 
            Sparrow sing the morning in
            You feel the light of day
            Can the promise of redemption reach that place ?
CHORUS          
The world breaks everyone
            And afterwards you will find some
            Stronger in their broken parts
            In the wild mountain of their hearts 
            Love can mend a broken soul
            But who can trust a heart not whole 
            Waiting for the wounds to close
            In that dark place
Hidden away down …          
 
I  KNOW THAT SOUND 
I  know that sound 
            It’s the night train passing 
            It won’t slow down
            Like some hope everlasting
            Sixty nights in the desert
            And the truth is still so far away
            Through all kinds of weather
            Wake up to the same day…
CHORUS
I’M STANDING ON THE SHORELINE
            AND MY LIFE IS FAR FROM HERE 
            DRINK TO END OF THE BOTTLE 
            AND TRY TO FIND SOME CHEER
Just you and I
  ‘Cos there’s safety in numbers
            Two wings to fly 
            We are lightning and thunder
            We stood at the edge of the forest 
            Daring to see who‘d go in 
            Like trying to join the chorus
            But really scared to sing
CHORUS:
            Once you were a dancer
            And your dream was loud and clear
            And you gave the world an answer
            Made the questions disappear          
BRIDGE:
            While the world is turning
            I don’t know if you’ve been around here
            It’s a spiritual dessert   
            And our leaders don’t have  an idea
I’m standing on the shoreline 
            And my life is so far from here
            So we drink to the end of the bottle 
            And try to drown this fear
            Once you were a dancer  
            And your dream was loud and clear
            And the world is spinning and spinning and spinning 
            While we try to find our way out of here
 
MANQOBA (Victorious)
When I look at all the choices I made in my life
            It’s like some natural law
            When they bring me trouble and strife
            I find my way to your door
            Like a wheel , turning round  and round 
            I always find you 
            And lay my head down
            We’re like some warriors from some forgotten war
            Recalling songs from a long forgotten shore
CHORUS
YITHI UMANQOBA ( we are the victorious

            UZODELA INKANI( you will be satisfied…
 
Once we were warriors 
            Now we are the playthings of fortune
            We always stood on solid ground
            Standing back to back 
            To the wind we threw caution
            Nothing could bring our hearts down
   Now I sometimes  feel we are nowhere bound
            Then I hear an old familiar sound
            It’s a song from a time when we were kings 
            Conquered the world and flew on eagle’s wings
CHORUS
Yesterday’s  gone  and tomorrow is just a dream
            All we have  is NOW
            Nobody knows where the time goes , where the time goes ….

She’s the daughter of eden
            She’s sister of hope
            She’s the   mother freedom
            She’s the lover I know
            She laughs and she jokes
            She   drinks and she smokes
            And she tells it like is
            Cause her mind is an   arrow
            She can’t help herself
            It’s the truth’s magnetic pull
            It’s the   eye of the bull
            And it makes you think
            While you bleed
            What do you   really believe?
            When the chips are down
            Its people who count
            And   she fights for those
            Whose voices are drowned
            Whose voices are   drowned
            Chorus
            And she looks at the world
            Through the eyes in   her heart
            But the picture gets blurred
  ‘cause she feels every part
            and   she turns your head
            cause she’s got great legs!
            And walks on the   earth
            Like its child from birth
            Oh.. the natural power!
            And the   hips that sway!
            She’s the daughter of eden

My bloed is koud,   en ek word oud, soos tai Kalahari hout
            My blood is cold , and I grow old ,   like tough-hard Kalahari wood
Maar herrineringe aan jou stook die kole in my   hart
            But memories of you stoke the coals in my hart
Diep in my ..jy’s diep   in my..
            Deep inside me, you are deep inside me
Die afstand tussen ons   is so krom en skeef
            The distance between us , is bent and crooked
Selfs   die bottle sal my nie gou laat vergeet
            Even this bottle does’nt help me to   forget quickly
Daars n’ sagte klank in die nag se lug
            There is a gentle   sound on the evening air
as jy slaap in die donker en in jou drome vlug
            As   you sleep in the darkness and flee into your dreams
My bottle is gebreek en   my hart is seer
            My bottle is broken and my heart is sore
            Jy’s so ver van   my af , en die toekoms is leeg
            You are so far from me and the future is   empty

The Revolution Will Eat its Children (Anthem for Uncle Bob)
He’s a leader, talks of freedom
            He knows the power of   the Big Idea
            He’s a dealer, he’s a seeker
            Of the power that comes from   fear
            He gave his life to the party machine
            Holding on to a secret dream
            He   knows better than anyone
            Power comes from the barrel of a gun
            And he’s   rising up against them now
            And he’s rising up in country and town
            Rising   up against them now, rising up
            Chorus :
            The revolution will eat its   children
            I see the river of dreams run dry
            I’m so thankful I got to love   you
            You are the reason I survive
            The promise of a better life for   all
            The promise of freedom from hunger and war
            So many rose up to answer   the call
            And so many are no longer here at all
            The hopes of yesterday   drowning in shifting sands
  ‘cause something strange is going on across the   land
            Preaching water but drinking wine
            Power gets us every time
            The   more things change
            The more they stay the same
            And they’re rising up   against him now
            And they’re rising up in country and town
            And they’re   rising up, rising up
            CHORUS
            Free them from this   hunger,
            Free!

Touch the Sun

            Understanding strange moments in the game

            Its hard to   know to make a change
            Its hard to give up what you got and walk away
            So   I've got to go now, and face this day
            CHORUS
            You know
            Its hard   to fight
            On your own against the fading of the light
            From the school to   the church to heart of the state
            To the invisible power of the hidden hand of   hate
            Where was I when this all began
            From the father, to the son, to the   man
            So I've got to go now and face this day
            CHORUS

          New World Survivor
Into 
  The Picture
Mercy in bondage
            In the final war for peace
            Peasants, rebels, outcasts
            Citizens' police
This crazy century
            and a dazzling frontier
            And the shameless guilt of the domain of the world
            And the genocide of innocence
Hackers, slackers, generation-X 
            backpackers
            Tribesmen and rockstars on silicone screens
            Virtual emotions, digital dreams
            Rushing for tomorrow where the future used to be
Chorus
I see the picture
            I feel strong
            I see the river
            Flowing on
Do you see the picture?
            Do you feel strong?
            Do you see the river
            Flowing on and on and on?
I've been waiting for what 
            you're waiting for
            I've been knocking at the same door.
            I want to know what
            We have become.
I want to touch your face, 
            I want to get a sense of place
            Before we step out into the sun.
Blue electric oceans
            Information streams
            Webs and nets in motion
            Connecting you and me...
Chorus
I see the picture
            I feel strong
            I see the river
            Flowing on
Do you see the picture?
            Do you feel strong?
            Do you see the river
            Flowing on and on and on?

Colours 
            Of Change
I'm showing you this picture
            Because it changed all that I am
            It's a picture of somebody
            She's beautiful and holding my hand
At the moment they took the 
            picture
            I felt a moment of something real
            And I knew I could be somebody
            And change this life I feel
I feel a new day coming on
            See colours of change
            I feel a new day coming on
I know the feeling of every 
            man who's lived alone
            And found that special place that he could call his own
            Not that it means anything at all (x2)
            She's just the one who gives me
            A place in this world
For an instant
            I felt the sun was shining down on me
            And I knew
            I had the chance
            To be somebody
I feel a new day coming on
            See colours of change
            I feel a new day coming on
(bye bye loneliness - hello 
            love)

Cha 
            Cha In The Rain
Black Rain fall into my life
I'm looking for a woman who 
            has seen some pain
            Looking for a woman who can dance through the flame
            Are you looking at me mama 'cause I'm looking at you
Can you Cha Cha mama?
            Cha cha in the rain
Cha Cha mama
            Cha cha in the rain
Black rain falling down
            Gives my life such a sad sad sound
            Black rain falling down
            Tear from the Heaven is a tear on the ground
Chorus
Can you cha cha mama
            Can you cha cha in the rain?
The days are long and the living 
            is hard
            Never had wheels or a credit card
            But I'll give you loving through the darkest day
            And when the times are tough we can cha cha in the rain
Cha Cha mama
            Cha cha in the rain
Black rain falling down
            Gives my life such a sad sad sound
            Black rain falling down
            Tear from the Heaven is a tear on the ground
Can you cha cha mama
            Can you cha cha in the rain?
Black Rain fall into my life
Black rain falling down
            Gives my life such a sad sad sound
            Black rain falling down
            Tear from the Heaven is a tear on the ground
Can you cha cha mama
            Can you cha cha in the rain?

New 
            World Survivor
I was sitting at the corner 
            cafe
            Looking across Montego Bay
            I wanted to remember the perfect view
            But I was looking at my watch 
            I was waiting for you
            With secrets and your eyes that sing
            With your soft skirt flowing in the wind
            It's a picture that you always paint
            Between the sinners and the saints
Is this water?
            Am I drowning?
            Is this water?
There's a boat out on the ocean.
            There's a swimmer in the tide.
            There's a nervous crowd that's watching
            Hope he makes it to the other side...
Ah Ah
            In this strange and new territory
            I await your arrival
            I'm strong when you stand next to me
            I'll be your new world survivor
In a world that's changing
            Nothing is what it seems
            The old order is caving
            Hold onto your dreams
You stand out like a beacon 
            in the night
            My ship is sailing by your true light
            All around us everything falling
            Everything falling
Is this water?
            Am I drowning?
            Is this water?
There's a boat out on the ocean.
            There's a swimmer in the tide.
            There's a nervous crowd that's watching
            Hope he makes it to the other side...
Ah Ah
            In this strange and new territory
            I await your arrival
            I'm strong when you stand next to me
            I'll be your new world survivor
I see the promise of your light
            As we sail across these dark oceans of change
Ah Ah
            In this strange and new territory
            I await your arrival
            I'm strong when you stand next to me
            I'll be your new world survivor

Africa 
            Rising
Keep this for protection
            Deep in your heart
            It's the Kalahari blowing
            Under a southern star
There's a new day coming
            I feel it in my bones
            Africa Rising
            From blood on the stones
I feel the wind in my sails
            I know I can fly
            I'm going to break these chains
            Under a blood red sky
I said Hey La
            I said Helele
            I said Hey La
            I said Hala
Isoka lapha wena ukhatizwe
Good young people
            Born to bad times
            Where the prophjets have failed
            And the river runs dry
            There's a new day coming
            Across the divide
            Africa Rising
            Against yesterday's tide
I see the young are strong
            And their dreams are proud
            Their hearts are on fire
            Where silence once stood
I said Hey La
            I said Helele
            I said Hey La
            I said Hala
Suka lapha wena weqath'izwe
            ('Leave this place, you who incited the nations tofight')
Baleka wena weqath'izwe
            ('Flee, you who incited the nations tofight')
Sesikhatele
            ('we are tired')
African moon
            Keep on rising
            Shine on to the sea of Japan
            Millions in the darkness waiting
            From Kowloon to Amsterdam
Very soon I must be leaving
            I hear your mother call my name
            Passing through the midnight hour
            I feel no pain
I said Hey La
            I said Helele
            I said Hey La
            I said Hala

Naked 
            In The Rain
            I feel nervous about these times she said
            It's like the beginning of the fall of Rome
            I feel lost on this rising tide she said
            Of superhighways and genetic clones
And I miss you like mad
            When you go away
            And I fear the things I read about
            These coming days
A digital picture wired to 
            the moon
            A chemical sister
            Yoiu know she's coming soon
A virtual lover always waiting 
            there for you
            And the human touch
            Fades into the blue
I feel blue
            I feel strange
            I feel naked in the rain
And I know
            In this world
            Very little stays the same
If you could see me now
            Would you remember my name?
'cause I could never forget 
            you
A software prophet said the 
            other day
            This the final ride we're on our way
            Like a weapon ready to unleash its load
            We're genetically coded to decode our code
And I miss you like mad
            When you go away
            And I fear the things we read about
            These coming days
I feel blue
            I feel strange
            All these pictures in the rain
All those times
            All those moments
            Lost forever
            Like tears in the rain
I could never forget you
I feel new
            I feel strange
            I feel naked in the rain
And I know
            In this world
            Very little stays the same
'cause I could never forget 
            you
 
Always 
            On Time
Each day is a train thundering 
            down my back
            Every moment I'm looking for a new plan of attack
            Every night I lie awake listening to the river flow
            Time is slipping away
            I watch each second of it go
Then you step out smiling in 
            the sun
            And I knew that if I waited
            You would come
Always on time
            Never like the others
            Always on the line
            Showing your true colours
            My true other
            You are my true other
I see others run
            I even see some of them fly
            I'm standing on the earth but I'm thinking of the sky
            Where do I belong?
            Is there a place here for me?
            I don't want to be a passing moment in someone else's dreams
Then you step out smiling in 
            the sun
            And I knew that if I waited
            You would come
Always on time
            Never like the others
            Always on the line
            Showing your true colours
            Always on time
            My true other
            You are my true other
There's a picture of my loneliness
            It's a man on a highway 
Walking
There's a picture of my loneliness
            It's a boy at the station 
Waiting
You are where I want to be
Always on time
            Never like the others
            Always on the line
            Showing your true colours
            Always on time
            My true lover
            You are my true lover
There's a picture of my loneliness
            It's a man on the highway 
Walking
There's a picture of my loneliness
            It's a boy on the station 
Waiting

Brave 
            New World
I know it's coming wrong or 
            right
            I'm leaving flesh and blood behind
            All that I have left is my mind
            The last trace of the human sign
Take my life and clone me do
            Turn me into something new
            Promise me a brand new day
            Take these human chains away
You can change me
            Rearrange me
            You can turn me inside out
            The future's calling I'm not stalling
            I'm on the edge you can hear me shout
It's a brave new world
I'm tired of this human shape
            Inside me lies a cyber ape
            New world is calling out my name
            Time to make my great escape
Take my life and clone me do
            Turn me into something new
            Promise me a brand new day
            Take these human chains away
You can change me
            Rearrange me
            You can turn me inside out
            The future's calling I'm not stalling
            I'm on the edge you can hear me shout
It's a brave new world
Maybe it's good to dance andsing, 
            laugh and cry
            Maybe there's something special in the human eye
            Maybe I know I'll miss your tender touch
            cause I'm a prisoner of hope
            You know that much
Take my life and clone me do
            Turn me into something new
            Promise me a brand new day
            Take these human chains away
You can change me
            Rearrange me
            You can turn me inside out
            The future's calling I'm not stalling
            I'm on the edge you can hear me shout
It's a brave new world

Universal 
            Men
I have undone this distance
            So many times before
            It seems as if this life of mine
            Is trapped between two shores
            As the little ones grow older on the station platform
            I will undo that distance just once more
My brothers and my sisters 
            have been scattered in the wind
            Dressed in cheap horizons that have never quite fitted
            And for centuries they've travelled in a pale phantom ship
            Sailing for that shore which has no other
They made the world that you 
            live in 
            They made it go around
            They made the world we live in
They made the world that we 
            live in
            They make it go around
            They made the world we live in
They could not read
            And they could not write
            And they could not spell their names
            BUt they took this world in both hands
            And they changed it all the same
            And from whence they came and where they went
            Nobody knows or cares
They made the world that you 
            live in 
            They made it go around
            They made the world we live in
They made the world that we 
            live in
            They make it go around
            They made the world we live in
From our hands leap the buildings
            From our shoulders bridges fall
            We stand astride the mountain
            And pull out all the gold
            The rivers of our homelands
            Murmur in our dreams
            We are trapped inside that distance
            Until the future sets us free
They made the world that you 
            live in 
            They made it go around
            They made the world we live in
They made the world that we 
            live in
            They make it go around
            They made the world we live in

Ride 
            In Your Car
I woke up this morning
            I went to the window
            Mouth feels like a birdcage
            And I'm dying for a cigarette
Look across the skyline
            The morning sun is rising
            Air is thick and heavy
            Like the smell of opportunity
And I feel like a motherless 
            child
            I feel like a motherless child
Promises on the table
            Empty bottles on the floor
            Hoped I'd see your face again
            Waiting at my door
I remember how you used to 
            be wild 
            With your wheels on the road for miles and miles
I want to ride in your car
Cleaning up the kitchen
            Before I go to work
            Another dollar another day
            For some other jerk
Thinking of some other place
            Somewhere true
            Always planning my escape
            From the human Zoo
I remember how you used to 
            be wild 
            With your wheels on the road for miles and miles
I want to ride in your car

Across 
            The River
I've been watching you now 
            for a long long time
            Across the river you've been waiting for the tide
            Everything that you ever did is in your eyes
            I can see you coming out in the shadow of the moonlight
Like you I've struggled with 
            the question of right life
            Like you I've been in the belly of the night
CHORUS
Hold me close it's dark and 
            cold outside
            It's raining days and nights into our lives
            Into our Lives
The captain says that it doesn't 
            look so good from here
            Hope and mercy are stranded on the pier
            Love is the prisoner of the dark and the weird
            Only the stars in heart will guide you clear
Like you I've struggled with 
            the question of right life
            Like you I've been in the belly of the night
CHORUS
Hold me close it's dark and 
            cold outside
            It's raining days and nights into our lives
            I can make it on my own
            But it's good to have you by my side.
            Hold me close it's dark and cold outside
Only the stars in your heart 
            (yelele mama)
CHORUS
Hold me close it's dark and 
            cold outside
            It's raining days and nights into our lives

Father
Buttons from a uniform
            A cartridge from the war
            Letters to my mother
            Hidden in a drawer
All around me empty space
            Never filled by a father's face
            In my mind he's strong and warm
            I like the picture I have drawn
He's a shadow man
            He's my father
            He's the hidden link in my chain
            He's a shadow man
            He's my father
            He's the one who lives inside my name
            I'm the only link in the chain
Fragments of memories
            From other people's lives
            Gather and collect them
            To see my father's eyes
Eyes to see the future come
            Eyes to see the past
            Eyes to see his only son
            From whom he was cast
He's a shadow man
            He's my father
            He's the one who lives inside my name
            He's a shadow man
            He's my father
            I'm the only link in the chain
What you gonna be when you 
            grow up?
            How you gonna fill that empty cup?
            Be strong and hold your head up high
            Teach yourself how to fly
He's a shadow man
            He's my father
            He's a shadow man

Love Is Just A Dream (Tatazela)
Something in the way she moves
            In the way she touches me
            In a way that no one can ever do
            Something in the way I feel
            When she's standing there
            Makes me feel more real than the rain
            Igama lami 'nkunzi emnyama

  "Make my heart beat like a drum"
            Time, time, time, can we hold the line?
            Can I keep this picture forever?

          Heat, Dust & Dreams
These days
Yashimbawula! (the watchman's fire is burning)
What happened to the diamonds in your eyes,
What happened to the hunger for the day's chase?
What happened to the electric smile
That danced across your face
We used to talk about changing the world
Now all you want to do is change your name
Come on baby don't surrender now
to the empty heart of these days.
We used to talk so deep into the night
You had the heart of a wild horse running
You bared your soul to me
and we both knew these days were coming
Chorus:
These days -- blood in the heavens
These days -- fire and ice
These days -- burning streets and visions
These days -- of the loveless child
Yashimbawula!
You were the reason I came here
You will always be the one I am looking for
I can't stand to see the way
these days are pushing you against the wall
Got to get up, got to move out
Face the tide beyond the door
Outside there's a whole world changing
We can't stand here, trapped inside
Let's step out and test the weazther
Hang on baby, it's going to ge a rough ride thru'
Chorus
These days -- searching for a vision
These days -- gun metal blue
These days -- changing my religion
These days -- heartless and cruel
say the words and fill my sails
I will love you through the coming gale
we'll get through the darkest heart of these days
"It's killing time"
Who will watch the watchers?
Who will keep the keepers?
Who will love the lovers -- could you?

The Crossing (OSIYEZA)

            at every breath that I take
            through all the nights I've lain alone
            in someone else's dream, awake
            all the words in truth we have spoken
            that the wind has blown away

The Promise
            Electric chair didn't burn a hair
            and the newspaperman asked why
            and while the warden explain in great detail
            the newsman looked in the sky
  "I'm sure!", he said, "if you look a little deeper
            for something in his life
            we could understand the reason why
            he reached out for a knife."
            Oooh! What happened to the promise?
            Oooh! what happened to the one we knew?
            So, onto a a train the newspaperman rode
            down to the southern lands
            to find out about a child long gone
            turned into a lightning man.
            Chorus:
            Oooh! what happened to the promise?
            Oooh! what happened to the one we knew?
            Oooh! what happened to the promise?
            Oooh! what happened to the heart so true.
  "Some of them make it through", she said
  "some of them never do, and one of them
            got lost in time -- that child of mine
            Oh, I loved that child of mine!"
            Arriving in a country town
            with a notepad in his hand
            he spoke to the mother and the father
            and a friend and a teacher and a preacher man
            They all recalled a regular boy chewing gim
            and playing in the sand
            nothing could explain how he became
            a lonely lightning man
            And when the coffin came
            on the southbound train
            and the old folks shuffled by
            the one they came to bury
            was not very heavy, just a child lost in time

            What happens to the clear blue eye
            when it enters the forest?
            does anybody know where the little one goes?
            what happens to the child in time?
            -- some of them make it through
            -- some of them never do
            -- some of them are lost and saved

In My African Dream
            Something broke the place where the rain is born
            something stole the promise from the light of dawn
            people, people were everywhere struggling to get their share
            honest cruelty in the eyes of the innocent
            squeezing one more harvest from this tired earth
            they call to you, but the wind just blows away their words
            didn't believe in miracles, didn't believe you'd come
            didn't see any reason to carry on
            Chorus:
            But in my African Dream, you touched my face
            raised up my children and gave them grace
            in my African Dream you wiped away my tears
            and whispered the promise of a thousand years
            Children with eyes like souls ready to fly
            looking at me -- for some kind of sacred sign
            who will teach the young, the names of the ancient ones
            who will tell them from whence they come
            I have no answer, don't even have a prayer
            All I can do is close my eyes and hope that you will be thre
            In my African Dream you blessed the rain
            let me stand proud, eased the pain,
            you raised me up,
            gave me love, filled my cup.
            Old man sits in the shade of the thorn treee
            he says "these thorns are all that are true
            life is suffering, suffering is life,
            be happy with the small things that come to you
            They will come to you, come to you."

Emotional Allegiance (Stand by me)
            I don't want to be a tourist in your heart
            I don't want to visit someone else's ruins
            Don't want a day trip to the feelings in the dark
            Don't want a quick-fix honeymoon
            Bridge:
            We need: emotional allegiance, devotional love
            a living promise like in the story of RAM
            Chorus:
            Raghupati raghava raja Ram
            Patite pavana Sita Ram
            Stand be me -- feel the sun
            Emotional allegiance -- divine love
            There's a change in the weather
            and a hole in the sky
            snow in the summer
            and the rivers run dry
            who will guard your fragile dreams of rain
            when your heart is tired of daytrippers
            and nobody stays....
            Bridge:
            We need: emotional allegiance, devotional love
            a living promise like in the story of RAM

Foreign nights (Working dog in Babylon)
            (for Jenny)
            I'm a working alien in a land of heat and stone
            a casualty of an economic war
            that took me away from home.
            It's the politics of money and power
            It's the hope that we can build a future in world
            getting smaller everywhere
            Bridge:
            I can hear a siren in the workyard
            another shift and I'll be closer to you
            I'm a working dog in Babylon and only
            your love can get me through
            Chorus:
            Foreign nights -- took you away from me
            Foreign nights -- are not where I belong
            Foreign nights -- filled with dust and dreams
            Foreign nights -- trapped me in Babylon
            As long as I keep moving
            I know I will be all right
            cause if I stop to think I'll drown and sink
            in the sea of foreign nights
            I've got to keep my hands busy
            got to keep pushing through
            got to learn to deal with this time away from you
            Bridge:
            I can hear a siren in the workyard
            another shift and I'll be closer to you
            I'm a working dog in Babylon and only
            your love can get me through
            Chorus....
            Quiet moments in the dark are hardest to face
            the sun goes down but not the pain
            I want to be with you all the time
            I want to be with you, to be with you all my life
            I'm going to have to get through... foreign nights.

Scatterlings of Africa
            Copper sun sinking low
            Scatterlings and fugitives

            On the road to Phelamanga
            Beneath the copper sun
            And I love the scatterlings of Africa
            Each and every one
            In their hearts a burning hunger
            Beneath the copper sun
            Broken wall, bicycle wheel
            African sun forging steel, singing
            Magic machine cannot match

Spirit is the Journey
            Ploughed the moon reached an island
            Balanced on the edge of the sky
            But something always stayed the same
            Deep down inside
            No matter where I've been the places don't count
            Summer in a mountain town
            No matter where I've been the places don't count
            And I feel let down
            'Cause nobody told me
            Spirit is the journey
            Body is the bus
            I am the driver
            From dust to dust
            Spirit is a story
            Body is a book
            I am the writer
            Together we flow
            We hold on, and when the story ends
            We hold on, until it begins again
            We hold on, we hold on...
            I never knew I had one
            Till I saw yours shine
            Spilling from your laughter
            Sparkling in your eyes
            Sharing my confusion, sharing my surprise
            At finding part of me in you, alive
            'Cause nobody told me
            Spirit is the journey
            Body is the bus
            I am the driver
            From dust to dust
            Trying to be near you
            Searching for a way
            Listening to your life song
            Before it fades away
            We hold on, and when the story ends
            We hold on, we hold on.
            Spirit is the journey
            Body is the bus
            I am the driver from dust to dust
            Now I'm falling, falling away
            I hear you calling, calling my name
            Spirit move on, move on
            Pass my eyes on, on to the next one
            I will be long gone, long gone
            Across the distance, this divide
            I will be with you forever
            Till you reach the other side
            So hold on, sing this life song
            Sing "hold on, hold on, hold on
            Hold on!"

Digging For Some Words
            Chorus
            Wanderers and nomads have gone to see their chieftains
            Will this be the end of the rain and the birds?
            Who can send an emissary to speak to the seasons?
            For the ravens and the crows already soak up the skies...
            I'm digging for some words beneath the stones in Zimbabwe
            I'm searching for a drum song in the jungles of Zaire
            I'm groping for the blood-moon in the mountains of Malawi
            Looking for the Lion of Ethiopia...
            The setting dusk is darkened by the bark of the baboon
            The frogs and the owls no longer call to the moon
            The warlords have gathered, blue smoke hiss from teeth of chrome
            And the baobab lies trembling in the boiling blood-loam
            The fireplace is broken and the grinding stone too
            Its million pieces flung across the plains of Africa
            Each dusty fragment a seed from which grows
            The memory of a debt that only you and I will know
            Chorus
            Seven seasoned soldiers have been summoned from Saigon
            A craven walkie talkie puts their bloodshot armor on
            Some drink beer milk, some drink kinky-kola
            Sheep dogs live in Outeniqua
            Gun dogs in Angola
            Flames lick the corners of each hungry horseman's smile
            They have locusts in their scabbards and deserts in their eyes
            Passing through the air they leave a sea of fetid rumors
            As they ride across the skyline on a secret trail of lies
            Chorus
            I found some words beneath a stone in Zimbabwe
            I heard a distant drum song in the jungles of Zaire
            The blood-moon spoke of war in the mountains of Malawi
            But I never found the Lion of Ethiopia

Kwela Man
Long ago there was a sound in the night
            A Kwela man singing under the street light
            With a cheap guitar he gave his sorrow a smile
            And he sowed his songs in the alley ways mile upon mile
            Chorus
            Ye hum ho la lo Kwela man

            You gave it your life
            Living low with the pennywhistle-tea-chest-base-gang
            I followed him home and he danced as he sang
            But now he's gone
            Not even the slightest traces
            Of a Kwela song
            And the street is full of empty spaces
            Chorus
            Nobody knows did he survive the winding road
            Did he find a song that took him back to the heartland
            Here I stand lost in a memory
            Of a Kwela man singing in the long gone twilight
            Chorus
            When I followed you home Kwela man
            You filled my soul, Kwela Kwela
            When you sang your song Kwela man
            You gave it your life

Simple Things
            Rain forest talking to the dragon-mountain-moon
            Stars infest the heavens in the southern skies
            Otter swim against the river, whisper in the water
            The stars are dead and what you see are shining lies
            Body-smoke tie the night in a misty web of blue
            Simple things are all we have left to trust
            An apple, a horse, some milk and a little bread
            Will help time stop slipping through our fingers

            A simple thing you got left to trust
            Someone in your heart singing
            Crickets learn the final chorus of their night song
            Standing at your door 'cause I have nowhere else to go
            Tried to fill the empty spaces with my songs
            Came here 'cause I know you also sometimes feel this way
            I brought an apple, a horse, some milk and a little bread
            I hope I will not find you smiling in a dream
            For I have come too far to face again what I have

            Like a comet in the night
            Beads of sweat glisten
            In the underground light
            Smoulder boudler
            Rock reeks fumes
            Songs of the outlands
            Change colour when shift is due
            And you've grown a little older
            Seen bone blown smoking blue!
            Chorus
            Grow city grow
            Ten thousand men below
            Bleed the burning womb
            Make the sun-rock show
            In the wider horizon
            Where a million lifetimes flow
            And you know the secret
            That glitters and glues the best
            Like the feathers of a dead bird
            That feather the next bird's nest
            Jwanasibeki!
            Tomorro, tomorro, tomorro
            Wo-hum-m-wo-hum!
            Wo-hum-wo-lo-lo-ma!

            Can you hear, can you hear me
            Can you hear, can you hear me
            In the wider horizon
            There's a life-song
            All my life gone
            In a mine song
            I shake the world beneath your feet
            'Cause I'm just working a little bit

(The young boys are coming,
the young boys are coming.
They carry homemade weapons and a bazooka.
They say "We have agreed to enter a place
that has never been entered before
by our parents or our ancestors
and they cry for us, for we do not have the right to vote.)
Hayiyaah!
The west is sleeping in a fragile freedom
Forgotten is the price that was paid
Ten thousand years of marching through a veil of tears
To break a few links in these chains
These things come to us by way of much pain
Don't let us slip back into the dark
On a visible but distant shore -- a new image of man
The shape of his own future, now in his own hands -- he says:
Chorus:
One 'man, one vote -- step into the future
One 'man, one vote -- in a unitary state
One 'man, one vote -- tell them when you see them
One 'man, one vote -- it's the only way
Bayeza abafana abancane
(The young boys are coming)
Hayiyaah!
In the east a giant is awakening
And in the south we feel the rising tide
The soul inside the spark that gives breath to your life
Can no longer be made to hide
These things come to us by way of much pain
Don't let us slip back into the dark
On a visible but distant shore -- a new image of man
The shape of his own future, now in his own hands -- he says:

Cruel Crazy Beautiful World

            Every time you wake up I hope it's under a blue sky
            It's a cruel crazy beautiful world
            One day when you wake up I will have to say goodbye
            Goodbye -- It's your world so live in it!
            Beyond the door, strange cruel beautiful years lie waiting for you
            It kills me to know you won't escape loneliness,
            Maybe you lose hope too

            I feel weak and strong at the same time

            You are a dreamer of dreams walking a lonely shore
            Dream if you will but remember there are iron laws
            However much you seek to solve this mystery
            No one ignores the iron vice of history
            All those gone before dreamed to escape

            Standing at the gates
            This is Jericho
            And the walls reach up to the stars
            And outside we were singing psalms
            Such a strange, strange place
            For we are the prisoners
            Of the prisoners we have taken
            And the prophets' dreams are now forsaken
            Sing me the songs of a world that I once knew
            Recall the legends once so proud and true
            My people used to live here not so long ago
            But they fled into the night and I was left alone

Dela (I Know Why The Dog Howls At The Moon)
            One day I looked up and there you stood
            Like a simple question looking for an answer
            Now I am a whale listening to some inner call
            Swimming blindly to throw myself upon your shores
            But what if I don't find when I have landed
            Would you leave me here to die on your shores stranded?
            I think I know why the dog howls at the moon.
            I think I know why the dog howls at the moon.
            I say:

            A blind bird sings inside the cage that is my heart
            And the image of your face comes to me when I'm alone in the dark
            If I could give a shape to this ache that I have for you
            If I could find the voice that says the words that capture you

            Flapping round your deadly flames
            Walking on the old high wire
            Trying to keep myself away
            You come walking down your marble stairs
            Throwing back your yellow hair
            And I want you and I need you

            You always go out when I want to sleep

            War and peace and night and day
            Who can understand

            I'm a foot without a shoe, I'm the fuzz without a clue
            I'm a ship without a crew, I'm lost without you
            One and one that can't make two, carrots looking for some stew
            A lawyer with no one to sue, I'm lost without you
            I'm the sky that's lost its blue, I'm the beer that just won't brew
            I'm a stamp that has no glue, I'm lost without you
            A hound with no fox to pursue, I'm a cat that's lost its mew

Bombs Away

            I saw him run into the night
            And on his face, more than a trace
            Of wild fear in the eye
            He was haunted by a tragic dream
            Of people in death machines
            And he did not know which side he was on
            And he hated being in between oh
            Chorus:
            Bombs away, bombs away

            What will you do -- see you if I free you
            Into the night -- feel the fear
            Do you know your left from your right?
            He's tired of the lies
            He's tired of the truth
            They never give him what they say
            He's tired of the fight
            He's tired of the truce
            The blackmail of judgement day
            He believes in a magic wave
            That rolls on the sea of time
            That can touch every single human soul
            If they could recognize it when it came -- too late

Woman Be My Country
            Here we stand on the edge of the day
            Faces melting in the african rain
            So many seasons of silent war
            So many drowned before they reached the shore
            Nothing is clear to me any more in this sad and strange landscape
            I've got no defense, I've got no attack
            I can't leave, I can't stay and I've got no way back

            Too many young people just wasted away
            Too many futures hanging in the balance
            Too much owing nothing left to pay
            A lonely flag flutters in the breeze
            for the hardened hearts who still want to believe
            Am I the witness or am I the crime
            A victim of history or just a sign of the times
            Across my heart questions and shadows still fly
            But in the dead of the night I know where the answer lies
            Chorus:
            Woman be my country, 'till my country can be mine

            But I was young and I got them mixed up
            And so forgot my name
            As I tried to remember you were standing next to me

            Wearing rags of glory
            And when you rejoiced they saw you smiling at your rejoicing
            When you wept they saw you smiling at your weeping
            When you smiled they saw you smiling at your smiling
            And you said "That's the way I've survived these years of dust and
            blood."

            In our hearts we feel it
            A mighty dream is coming true
            Hold on and we'll dream it
            Keep it up we're going to push it through

            Resisting the fascist' ploy
            The underground puts iron in the heart of any boy
            Swimming in a sea of pain, he knows this is the end
            He hears himself whisper the name of his best friend
            Chorus:
            I never betrayed you, and I never betrayed the revolution
            I just didn't want to die alone, I needed you to see me home
            And if I could save you, and if I could find a solution
            I would die a thousand times, to get you out of here
            Sharing the same cold cell
            Betrayer and betrayed
            An island with two frightened castaways
            Not a word is spoken,
            How can he explain?
            Through swollen eyes they watch the dawn's first rays
            It's all over now
            They stand backs to the wall
            Waiting for the fascist's sword to fall
            In the desperation of a young life about to end
            He turns before the bullet
            And forgives a friend
            Chorus

Webaba sicel'impilo
(Father, give us life, save our lives)
At the end of all bloody human storms
As the last embers and flames glow
We peer up into the wounded sky
And search for the human rainbow
And in the fading light I wonder why
We can never free it from the sky
Wangitshela lendaba
(You have told me of this thing)
I can see it, but never be it, until I free it
>From the sky
Chorus
Same old human story
The saddest winds do blow
While we are trapped in the language of dark history
Underneath a human rainbow
An angry young man draws in the air
Political equations
But time corrupts the fruit they bare
And leads to more desperation
While in the sky -- it's a trick of the light
Shine the colors of all creation
Chorus
Ngizokutshela!

Talk to the People
            There's a brawl in a lonely whites only bar
            A lekker groove in a classy shebeen
            Someone betrayed in a government car
            A silent movement on the stock market screen
            A watchman playing on a Zulu guitar
            A white soldier's blues in camouflage green
            A migrant worker who's come too far
            A sailor aground in a submarine

            A tribal feud in a municipal 'pound
            A squatter with an ox but no land to plough
            A shipment of A.K.s on the underground
            A throw of the dice on a Soweto train
            A waiting knife if you should win the game

Too Early for the Sky
            I nearly disappeared into the mouth of a crocodile
            I nearly touched the rain deep in the heaven on high
            I could have been a sad piece of news on the radio

            Oh halala, I'm home, looks like I made it, Oh halalo

            The darkest night nearly swallowed up my eyes

I Call Your Name (Ngibiza Igama Lakho)
            Oh no, you've gone again
            I feel like Daniel in the lion's den
            Stone cold in the afternoon
            So alone in the empty room
            They say that four walls do not a prison make
            I'm trying to find a way out but there seems no escape
            When I feel the hidden power that lies inside your sound
            Like the ghost inside the atom that spins it round and round
            There's magic in some words, some things you can't explain
            That conjures up that feeling of the sun inside the rain
            Chorus

            I reach out and touch you
            And I call your name -- ngibiza igama lakho

Take My Heart Away

The Waiting
            Chorus
            Here we stand waiting on the plain
            Darkness has taken the last outpost of the day
            Somewhere gunships hunt their illusive prey
            And I know inside you feel the same way
            The sky in your heart is so grey
            And the jackals howl inside
            I see you walking with your head down
            Tomorrow is always betrayed
            By too much hope displayed
            So you take it as it comes now
            Ngempilo yami yonke
            (With all my life)
            I'm waiting, I'm waiting

            That connects each link of chain
            And you say you've got some peace of mind now
            But I know you're waiting all the same
            With an ache that has no name
            When you feel the fresh breath of the invisible wind
            Ngempilo yami yonke

            It's crazy, Joey, how she loves you come what may
            And though you have gone she defends you like a lion
            She says you're just going through some kind of phase
            Strange talk of deserts, Hong Kong and red wine

            She says every home ever built was built on tears
            And she's not scared of crying but she is of wasted years
            So she'll wait like a ship anchored beyond the harbour
            And if there is no place to dock she'll head for the sea
            And I don't know if you know but there's nothing much harder

            And carry on sing this song -- Siyayilanda

            Losers, keepers -- Siyayilanda
            Hold me close I'm trapped in
            A night of seasons -- Siyayilanda
            A new sun rising up ahead
            Coming your way -- Siyayilanda

            My day's a little nearer

Impi
Chorus:
Impi! wo 'nans' impi iyeza
Obani bengathinta amabhubesi?
            All along the river Chelmsford's army lay asleep
            Come to crush the Children of Mageba
            Come to exact the Realm's price for peace
            And in the morning as they saddled up to ride
            Their eyes shone with the fire and the steel
            The General told them of the task that lay ahead
            To bring the People of the Sky to heel
            Chorus
            Mud and sweat on polished leather
            Warm rain seeping to the bone
            They rode through the season's wet weather
            Straining for a glimpse of the foe
            Hopeless battalion destined to die
            Broken by the Benders of Kings
            Vainglorious General and Victorian pride
            Would cost him and eight hundred men their lives
            Chorus
            They came to the side of the mountain
            Scouts rode out to spy the land
            Even as the Realm's soldiers lay resting
            Mageba's forces were at hand
            And by the evening the vultures were wheeling
            Above the ruins where the fallen lay
            An ancient song as old as the ashes
            Echoed as Mageba's warriors marched away
            Chorus

            Oh will you bless my life?
            Oh will you bless my life?
            The warrior's now a worker and his war is underground
            With cordite in the darkness he milks the bleeding veins of gold
            When the smoking rockface murmurs, he always thinks of you
            African sky blue, will you see him through?

African Litany
            Trapped in a moment of history
            You changed the world and the day was yours
            Laughing sun flashing from your smile
            Your beach-bronzed body braced against the wind
            But you forgot the wheel keeps turning
            And one day the dawn left you behind
            And though I tried to love you
            I really have to go
            'Cause the world is leaving you behind
            The world is leaving you behind
            The world is leaving you behind

            And I hope we see these times through
            I think this dream is going to end
            The past is no longer your friend
            Memory upon memory binds you into a timeless web

Heart of the Dancer
            I want to look into the heart of the dancer
            His movements have a magic mystery
            They must have a message and a meaning
            'Cause he's doing something to me
            Please don't let the drum stop beating
            I have to understand
            How he dances our future and our destiny
            And how we became part of this land

            When you were just a witless child of wonder
            He showed you the glory of his past
            He weaved for you a dance of the thunder
            That shook the mountains and the craglands
            He dances the children playing in the rubble
            He dances the hollow victory
            He dances the powerful people ambushed by history

            The dance wants to dance the dancer
            But the dancer wants to dance the dance
            There's a war between the puppet and the master
            Between the master and the puppet-dancer's heart
            Have you seen the gunfire flash across the news in the night?
            Have you seen the bedroom scene in the ballet?
            Oh the dancing bear can't bear to dance much longer
            And soon the puppet will be the dance's master
            Soon the puppet will be the dance's master

High Country
            There's a girl who lives in the high country
            Where the willows do not weep
            And the rain falls softly and gently
            And does not disturb her sleep
            There's a girl who lives in the high country
            Who lives on tea and dreams
            And I know that she does not love me
            But she plays the game so well
  "Sit by my side and tell me boy
            Is the Milky Way that far? Is the universe really expanding?
            Tell me who you are?"
            I am a bondsman - a poor man
            I am a ghettoman - I am a thief
            Who saw the gutterman who has no compassion
            Who heard the widow who cannot weep
            In the backstreets, in the poor towns
            I hear a thunder which cannot roll
            Mine are the eyes that steal from the orphanage
            A groveller, groping in the grime
            Inside is a Congo-jungle-beast-lion-leopard-man
            A tiger-man from Timbuktu
            Even a lover-man strutting down the avenue
            A winding river searching for the sea...
            And she said that she understood me
            She thought I was complex and sensitive
  "Here" she said, "hold my hand,
            And have a muffin!"
  "Do you see the clouds boy?
            Do you see the ship?
            Do you see the duck?
            Do you love me?"
            Brick by brick the empire is crumbling
            Stone by stone it cracks and folds
            Dreams of phantoms plotting in the jungle
            Vengeance in the elephant grass
            Someone's been at the liquor cabinet
            She's sure someone's been wearing her shoes
            All around her chaos and anarchy
            Light and reason overthrown
  "I'm sure" she says, "they will attack the embassy,
            Take me home, take me home!"
            There's a wind that blows through the high country
            Where the mansion used to stand
            And it blows through the broken down garden
            Where she once held my hand.
            La, la, la, la...

Mama Shabalala
            An old lady walking down the dusty farm road
            Looking for a simple home
            She doesn't want anything extremely smart
            And she doesn't need a telephone
            She's the child of a refugee running from the Zulu war
            Living from hand to mouth, dodging the wrong arm of the law
            She's old and she's bent, her eyes can hardly see
            And she's going home forever to Weenen County

            She's built more homes than fingers on her hands
            A sharecropper's wife living on County Crown land
            And then they wrested the harvest from the land and its lords
            And when her man died she could cry no more tears
            And she had lost everything that she ever had to lose
            So she picks up her walking stick and puts on her car-tyre shoes
            And she's walking in a dream listening for that special sound
            The echo of the plough whip over Weenen County ground
  "Weenen County you took my man" she says
  "You took my home, you took my land
            You left me all alone - now I'm coming home."
            Weenen County in the springtime

            Got no money and I can’t get to sleep
            Takes all my courage to look   down that long road
            I am going to giyani
            With such a heavy load
            I’ve   got to:
            Shintsha (change)
            Qinga (strengthen myself)
            Qingel’isibindi   (take courage)
            And don’t give up
            Chorus
            Oh I’m going to   giyani
            Siyayibiz’ as’hambeni!
            As’hambeni
            Oh I’m going to touch
            That   magic mystery
            Leaving my troubles behind me
            Did you hear about the   mouse
            That went to the cat for love
            The cat said:
            Mouse, I can’t be   what your’e dreaming of.
            You’re so lonely. you’ve got it mixed up.
            You’re   looking down below for what lies up above.
            You’ve got to
            Shintsha   (change)
            Qinga (strengthen myself)
            Qingel’isibindi (take courage)
            Don’t   give up

Scatterlings of Africa
Copper sun sinking low
            Scatterlings and fugitives
            Hooded eyes and weary   brows
            Seek refuge in the night
            Chorus
            They are the scatterlings of   africa
            Each uprooted one
            On the road to phelamanga
            Where the world   began
            I love the scatterlings of africa
            Each and every one
            In their   hearts a burning hunger
            Beneath the copper sun
            Ancient bones from   olduvai
            Echoes of the very first cry
            Who made me here and why
            Beneath   the copper sun?
            African idea
            African idea
            Make the future clear
            Make   the future clear
            Chorus.....
            And we are the scatterlings of   africa
            Both you and i
            We are on the road to phelamanga
            Beneath a copper   sky
            And we are the scatterlings of africa
            On a journey to the stars
            Far   below, we leave forever
            Dreams of what we were

Great Heart
The world is full of strange behaviour
            Every man has to be his own   saviour
            I know I can make it on my own if I try
            But I’m searching for a   great heart to stand me by
            Underneath the african sky
            A great heart to   stand me by
            Chorus:
            I’m searching for the spirit of the great   heart
            To hold and stand me by
            I’m searching for the spirit of the great   heart
            Under african sky
            I’m searching for the spirit of the great   heart
            I see the fire in your eyes
            I’m searching for the spirit of the   great heart
            That beats my name inside
            Sometimes I feel that you really   know me
            Sometimes there’s much you can show me
            There’s a highway of   stars across the heavens
            The whispering song of the wind in the   grass
            There’s the rolling thunder across the savanna
            A hope and dream at   the edge of the sky
            And your life is a story like the wind
            Your life is a   story like the wind
            Chorus
            Guka ’mzimba (body grow old)
            Sala   ’nhliziyo (but heart remain behind)

Missing
Burning tyres on the freeway
            Noone in sight
            Thre’s a raging   calm
            Across the land tonight
            Voice on the radio says
            Another one’s down   tonight.
            It don’t matter anymore
            Which side he’s on.
            Came to your place   to see
            If you’re all right
            And the shadows
            Danced across the   stairway
            Flight after flight
            And I was banging at your door
            But you   weren’t there anymore
            And the g-man stepped
            Into the light and   said
            This is war!
            Chorus
            Uzogijima (you will run away)
            Well I’ve   got to get through
            ’cause I know that you are near the end
            Uzogijima (you   will run away)
            Uzogijima kodwa (you will run away but there
            Awusekho   umgodi is no hole left for you to hide in)
            Wokukasha
            When the big wind   blows
            The tree falls down
            But the reed just bends
            You’r   missing
            Roadblock across my heart
            And a riot in my mind
            ’cause I   know that you are
            Out there somewhere
            Trying to find a place to   hide
            The shadow of a ruthless hand
            Is hunting for your soul
            And though   I don’t know
            Where you are
            I’ll never let you   go
            Chorus...
            And I want you to know
            That as things fall   apart
            I’m on the road to nowhere
            And you’re heavy on my heart
            And I   want you to know
            That this state will never last
            Maybe better days are   coming
            And we’ll make peace with the past

Shadile (Ring On Her Finger)
Beyond freedom and dignity
            Beyond the dying of the light
            She takes   me
            Beyond reason and the trinity
            Beyond the sun and out of sight
            Oh no,   uh no, oh she did it again
            Oh no, uh no, she did it   again
            Chorus
            That girl is feeling
            Trapped by that ring on her   finger
            Ushadile (she’s married)
            Some man thought he shot her down,
            But   he only winged her
            Ushadile (she’s married)
            Trapped by the ring on her   finger...
            Such a dangerous affinity
            In such a deadly disguise
            Hot   summer nights and other promises
            She carries in her married eyes
            Oh no, uh   no, oh she did it again
            Oh no, uh no, she did it   again
            Chorus....
            You just can’t get enough
            So you come around   here
            And you do it again,
            You just can’t get   enough...

Third World Child
Bits of songs and broken drums
            Are all he could recall
            So he spoke to   me
            In a bastard tongue
            Carried on the silence of the guns
            It’s been   a long long time
            Since they first came
            And marched through our   village
            They taught us to forget our past
            And live the future in their   image
            Chorus
            They said
            ’you should learn to speak a little bit of   english
            Don’t be scared of a suit and tie.
            Learn to walk in the dreams of   the foreigner
            -- I am a third world child
            The outworld’s dreams are   the currency
            That grip the city streets
            I live them out
            But I have my   own
            Hidden somewhere deep inside of me
            In between my father’s   fields
            And the citadels of the rule
            Lies a no-man’s land which I must   cross
            To find my stolen jewel.
            They said
            ’you should learn to speak   a little bit of english
            Maybe practise birth control
            Keep away from   controversial politics
            So to save my third world soul
            Chorus
            They   said
            ’you should learn to speak a little bit of english
            Don’t be scared of   a suit and tie.
            Learn to walk in the dreams of the foreigner

            Bits of songs and broken   drums
            Are all he could recall

Berlin Wall
Welcome to my island
            But please don’t you stay too long
            I wouldn’t want   anyone to think
            That something’s going on
            Toe the line
            And you’ll be   fine
            You’ll see another day
            Don’t connect,
            Don’t reflect,
            Just fetch   your weekly pay
            Oh sister don’t you feel
            What I know inside my   bones
            I’ll meet you on the underground
            And we’ll make a call on the   telephone
            Chorus:
            Berlin wall
            Can you hear this call
            For one   world, one nation
            Who can it be banging at my door
            I can’t trust anyone   anymore
            I drink my beer in a state of fear
            Is tyher no salvation
            Wire   on the gate,
            Barbs of hate
            To separate one nation
            Around your   heart
            A ring of steel
            I can’t get out
            And I can’t get in.
            One   for all, and all for one
            Is the way it should be
            Every river I know
            Is   dreaming of the sea
            My body feels like a prison to me
            I’d like to fly and   touch you
            With a sacred dream
            Come on, mama, don’t delay
            I know you   think I’m far away
            I’m only looking for a sign --

Don't Walk Away
Dogs in the backyard
            And the flies are on the wall
            Thunder and   lightning
            But the rain don’t ever fall
            If there’s a flower in this   desert
            It’s your picture on my wall

            It’s for real
            You have to   face it in the end...
            The hard side of love

            Don’t   walk away --
            I need your love
            There’s nothing on the other side   ---
            This I say to you
            One day I know we will
            Free our lives.
            One day   I know we will
            Free our lives
            One day I know we’ll turn that tide.
            Let   the wheel turn one more time
            Woke up this morning
            While you were still   asleep
            Looked through the window
            Into the empty streey
            I don’t know   exactly
            What came over me
            But now I know baby
            I’m going to lay some of   this world
            At your feet
            Chorus....

            Wo!   yelele mama!
            Yelele mama a ye!
