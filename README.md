# Making a word cloud from lyrics

On [16th of July 2019 South African singer and activist Johnny Clegg passed away](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/16/johnny-clegg-south-african-singer-and-activist-dies-aged-66). As my personal tribute to him I have made a wordcloud from his lyrics in his image using python. 

### General procedure
- scrape lyrics and combine into string
- clean text and visualise words
- process the image to be used as mask
- finalise the wordcloud and save the image
